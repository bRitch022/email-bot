## Python Environment Setup
From within Linux environment:  
```sudo apt-get update```  
```apt-get install python3.10 python3.10-dev python3.10-venv```  

Ensure `python` is a link that points to python3.10  
```ls -l `which python`*```

If it is not:  
Assuming `python` is in `/usr/bin/`  
```rm /usr/bin/python```  
```ln -s /usr/bin/python3.10 /usr/bin/python```  

From the `email-bot` directory:  
```python -m venv pyenv```  
```source pyenv/bin/activate```  
```python -m pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Environment Variable Setup
* The `email-dot/emailHandler` directory contains a file called `.env.example`. Copy this file and rename it to `.env`.
** Note: The `.gitignore` file ignores .env files, so there is no risk of accidentally commiting credentials to the repo.
* Fill in credentials for `USERNAME` and `PASS` within the `.env` file, and Voil√†!

## Setup for Gmail (Depricated)
Gmail is quite secure, you'll need to enable 'Less Secure App Access'

Actually, we are now using OAuth2, and a `credentials.json` file containing the API key and secret is required to be in the `emailHandler` directory
